This help message is intended to get new users started with the
program.  We refer the user to the README file for a more detailed
description of the capabilities and limitations of the program.

The program works with a command interface. The list of available
commands is the following :

  - generators : Allows the user to enter an element of a Coxeter
    group in terms of generators.  The generators should be entered as
    a comma-separated list of positive integers.  The rank of the
    element must be at least as large as the largest generator.

  - permutation : Allows the user to enter an element of a Coxeter
    group as a signed permutation.  The permutation should be entered
    as a comma-separated list of integers.

  - print : Prints the signed permutation of the current element.

  - inverse : Prints the signed permutation of the inverse of the
    current element.

  - lefttikz : Prints tikz code for the left domino tableau of the
    current element.

  - righttikz : Prints tikz code for the right domino tableau of the
    current element.

  - leftdraw : Draws the left domino tableau of the current element in
    a graphical window.

  - rightdraw : Draws the right domino tableau of the current element in
    a graphical window.

  - bad : Returns "true" if the element is bad and "false" if the
    element is not bad.
