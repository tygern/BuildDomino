<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>Coxeter Groups</h2>

<p>This program was developed to preform operations on elements of type D
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxeter_group">Coxeter groups</a>.  For
more information on Coxeter Groups see James E. Humphreys'
<a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Reflection_Groups_and_Coxeter_Groups.html?id=ODfjmOeNLMUC">Reflection Groups and Coxeter Groups</a>.</p>

<h2>Domino Tableaux</h2>

<p>Build Domino is able to construct domino tableaux from elements of
type D Coxeter groups. Devra Garfinkle developed an algorithm similar
to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson%E2%80%93Schensted_correspondence">Robinson--Schensted correspondence</a>
to associate a signed permutations to a pair of domino tableaux. This
pair of tableaux are difficult to compute by hand but are very
useful. Like the Robinson--Schensted correspondence, this pair can be
used to calculate the Kazhdan--Lusztig cells of the Coxeter group.
The computation of these cells, as described in Garfinkle's papers,
<em>On the classification of primitive ideals for complex classical Lie
algebras</em> <a href="http://www.numdam.org/item?id=CM_1990__75_2_135_0">I</a>,
<a href="http://www.numdam.org/item?id=CM_1992__81_3_307_0">II</a>, and
<a href="http://www.numdam.org/item?id=CM_1993__88_2_187_0">III</a>, involves
moving tableaux through sets called <em>cycles</em>.  I hope to add these
calculations to a future version of BuildDomino.</p>

<h2>Heaps</h2>

<p>A heap is a useful tool in visualizing reduced expressions of an
element of a Coxeter group.  To construct a heap, we imagine dropping
wide blocks on the Coxeter graph corresponding to our group.  When we
try to place adjacent blocks there is not enough room, so they must
stack on top of each other.  A heap of an element of a Coxeter group
of type D is difficult to draw in two dimensions.  In the heaps
created by BuildDomino, it appears as if blocks labeled with 1 and 2
may occupy the same space, when actually they must sit beside each
other.</p>

<h2>Signed Permutations</h2>

<p>A
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperoctahedral_group">signed permutation</a>
is a map from the set {-n, -(n-1), ... , -1, 1, ... , n-1, n} to
itself such that x maps to y if and only if -x maps to -y. The set of
signed permutations can be represented as permutations of n coins
where flipping is allowed.  As with regular permutations, each signed
permutation can be written in <em>one line notation</em>.  A Coxeter group of
type B is isomorphic to the group of signed permutations, and a
Coxeter group of type D is isomorphic to an index 2 subgroup.</p>

<h1>Use</h1>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>You may input an element either as a signed permutation or as a
expression in terms of generators.  In either case, you must enter
your element as a list of integers separated by commas.  For example,
I would input the signed permutation that fixes 2 and 4, sends 1 to -3
and 3 to -1 as [-3, 2, -1, 4]. I would enter the element
(s1)(s2)(s3)(s4)(s3) as [1,2,3,4,3].  I use (s_3) as my
branch node for the type D
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxeter%E2%80%93Dynkin_diagram">Coxeter diagram</a>.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<h3>Elementary Calculations</h3>

<p>BuildDomino is able to compute the length, descent sets, and inverse
of an element.  It can also tell whether a particular element is a
<em>bad</em> element.  We define a bad element to be an element that has no
reduced expressions beginning or ending in two noncommuting generators
that is not a product of commuting generators.</p>

<p>The user also has the option of viewing your original element or its
inverse as a signed permutation or reduced expression.  This is
especially useful if you enter an element in terms of generators, or
when attempting to find reduced expressions corresponding to signed
permutations.</p>

<p>Each of these computations is conducted using the signed permutation
corresponding to the element.</p>

<h3>Domino Tableaux</h3>

<p>Once the user enters a Coxeter group element, BuildDomino can output
the right and left domino tableau.  The user has two choices for the
form of the output.  The tableau can be drawn in a graphical window or
can be written in <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/">TikZ</a> code
for inclusion in <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> documents.</p>

<h3>Heaps</h3>

<p>Once the user enters a Coxeter group element, BuildDomino can output a
heap corresponding to a reduced expression for the current element.  As
above, the user has two choices for the form of the output.  The heap
can be drawn in a graphical window or can be written in TikZ code.</p>
